#
# Declares role-based access permissions for the module, including
# those to administer the module, moderate content, author content,
# and view content.
#
# These permissions work together with folder-based access controls:
#
# - "administer foldershare" grants a user full access, similar to a 'root'
#   super-user on a Linux host. An administrator can create content,
#   view and edit everybody's content, and change ownership on that
#   content.  Folder-based access controls do not restrict an adminstrator.
#
# - "share foldershare" grants a user the ability to create new top-level
#   folders and adjust how they are shared with the public and
#   other users.
#
# - "author foldershare" grants a user the ability to create new files and
#   folders (but not top-level folders), and view and edit their own content.
#   Users also may be granted read and/or write access to top-level folders
#   owned by other users.
#
# - "view foldershare" grants a user the ability to view content, but not
#   modify it. Users also may be granted read access to top-level folders owned
#   by other users.
#
# In use, a typical site configuration might be:
#
# - Grant "administer foldershare" for a small group of trusted users who
#   can police content and answer customer support requests.
#
# - Grant "share foldershare" for managers, supervisors, prinicipal
#   investigators, and those able to take responsability for making content
#   public or shared with other users.
#
# - Grant "author foldershare" to all authenticated users so that they
#   can create and edit content. Anyone given "share" permissions hould
#   be given "author" permission too.
#
# - Grant "view foldershare" to all users, including anonymous users, so
#   that they can view published content. Anyong given "author" permissions
#   should be given "view" permission too.
#
# Administer permissions *do not* grant the user permission to alter
# module settings. This is strictly reserved for site administrators.
